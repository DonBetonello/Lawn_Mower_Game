# LawnMowerGame2
A unity mobile game to practice my skills

A made a simple little hipercasual game where you cut grass for money.

This is a game that i made to learn unity game development and not for gaining money from it.

In it there is a few simple upgrades that increase speed of lawnmover, grass recover etc. Also contains a drone upgrade that bounces from borders and cuts the grass for you. 
Added a flower upgrade that randomly spawns a flower in 3-5 minutes which gives you a X2 multiplier on money earning.
Added sounds to clicking buttons and also a button to turn sound off.
